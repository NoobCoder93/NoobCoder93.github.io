    <h1 class="test">Greetings!</h1>
    <h2 class="test1">Welcome to my website</h2>

    <p>Hi, my name is Jayson Acal, and this is my website. I made this simple website to test my knowledge in the basic of coding. Although this is not as grand as any other, I am proud of myself to have made this happen.</p>
    <p>I am currently a 3rd year BSCS student of JRMSU main campus. I have little knowledge about my course. But I am willing to learn for me to have a career in this industry.</p>
